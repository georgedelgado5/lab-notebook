## Reflection Document

### _NOTE : My notes are all logged after completing the entire notebook. I didn't realize I had to write a reflection after completing each section._

### HTML

I thought the first lab assignment was a perfect way to introduce students to the basics of HTML. I had some prior experience with HTML, so the lists assignment was straightforward. That said, I think it effectively showcases what HTML can do. The other assignments in this section were also informative. For example, learning to use an image file from a URL compared to directly from our working directory was helpful.

The table and form section provided a good introduction to the topic of accessibility, which we explored further in the next section. I found the table assignment particularly challenging at the time. Specifically, I had to think carefully about how the elements should be structured to achieve the desired format. This topic remains challenging for me and was a significant reason homework #2 took me longer to complete.

I was able to about 3 of 4 assignments on my own. I stayed after class to get clarification on the tables document.

### Accessibility

This section was the second most interesting topic of the class for me. I've used technology for so long without fully considering the experiences of others, particularly users with disabilities. Technology has advanced significantly, allowing us to create solutions for diverse backgrounds and circumstances. The screen-reader accessibility video shown in class was eye-opening. As developers, we should be more detailed in our use of semantic HTML. If I hadn't taken this class, I truly believe I would have continued making everything a "div" element until someone pointed it out. More importantly, using proper semantics helps make HTML more readable, even for developers themselves. It certainly helps me better understand the purpose of each element.

Resources such as WAVE are valuable for identifying and resolving accessibility issues quickly. WAVE was particularly useful because of its simplicity; it was easy to download as an extension and use whenever needed. I found it effective as an initial accessibility checker because it highlights major semantic issues. Other resources, such as W3C's checker, were my final step in verifying accessibility.

I was able to complete most of this assignment on my own. I stayed after class to get clarification on minor issues.

### CSS

CSS was the most important topic for me during the term. It wasn't until this section that I fully realized how powerful CSS is, though it was also the most challenging to master. Tools like Bootstrap and Tailwind have simplified CSS use significantly. This section alone could be taught as its own class. It was especially helpful to understand how classes and IDs are called and structured within a CSS stylesheet. I quickly applied the knowledge from this section to my internship. Tools like pseudo-elements, classes, and selectors helped me customize my HTML documents more effectively.

I had significant help from watching the lecture videos to complete this assigment. It wasn't particularly hard, it was just a matter of revisiting the topic.

#### Flexbox and CSS-Grid

Just before starting this class, I began experimenting with Bootstrap at my internship. Because Bootstrap provides pre-built elements, I found it easy to use, making this section feel more like a review than new material. However, using Bootstrap’s built-in JavaScript functionality was insightful. Previously, I had relied on AI to add functionality to my demo site, only to realize later that much of that functionality was already built into Bootstrap.

My opinion on this section might be somewhat biased due to my prior exposure. Nonetheless, understanding the fundamentals of CSS, Flexbox, and CSS Grid remains important for creating more customized web pages.

I had siginifcant help from wathcing the lecture videos and staying after class to ask questions. These topics were significantly challenging for me, more so flexbox. I found MDN and the lecture slides a great resource to reference.

#### Boostrap

Just before starting this class, I began experimenting with Bootstrap at my internship. Because Bootstrap provides pre-built elements, I found it easy to use, making this section feel more like a review than new material. However, using Bootstrap’s built-in JavaScript functionality was insightful. Before, I had relied on AI to add functionality to my demo site, only to realize later that much of that functionality was already built into Bootstrap.

My opinion on this section might be somewhat biased due to my prior exposure. Nonetheless, understanding the fundamentals of CSS, Flexbox, and CSS Grid is so important for creating more customized web pages.

I was able to complete this assignment on my. However, I used the lecture slides and Bootstrap documentation to finish these assignments.

### JavaScript

Learning and applying JavaScript has been my favorite part of this class, even though I still struggle to fully maximize its potential. I also found this section moderately challenging. I entered this class with minimal programming knowledge and was concurrently enrolled in Karla Fant's Intro to CS, where we learn programming fundamentals using C++. Most of my study time went into Karla's class, limiting the time I had to practice JavaScript. However, nearing the end of the term, I'm beginning to see overlapping fundamentals between different programming languages.

The recorded lectures were extremely helpful throughout this lab notebook and especially useful in the JavaScript section. I would first watch the lectures to understand your flow and process, then attempt the assignments on my own, reinforcing my understanding of new JavaScript features. MDN Web Docs was another helpful resource, providing detailed explanations and examples. I also utilized office hours, CS tutors, and AI tools whenever I was stuck on a concept.

I had significant help from the lecture vides to complete these assignments. JavaScript is new to me so I still need to be walked through a process. That said, after watching the videos, I feel more confident with the material. I was able to apply my new learned skills at work.

### jQuery

jQuery is a game changer. Having to work through using vanilla JavaScript to make the Game of Thrones page was tedious. I was amazed at how many lines of code we could reduce by using this tool. It's definitely going to take me time to get used to the syntax, but I would rather write less code in the long run. This section was straightforward; however, it would have been great to get more practice. I think having us use vanilla JavaScript and jQuery in homework #3 would have provided enough practice to solidify its usefulness.

The concept of jQuery is failry straightforward, but it's the syntax application that I find challenging. I had to use the lecture videos to get complete this section.
